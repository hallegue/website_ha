    "text": "Why study offspring sex ratio?\n\n\n\nIn many animal species, the sex ratio of offspring can vary depending on environmental, social, and parental factors. This phenomenon is particularly interesting in polygynous species like southern elephant seals, where a small number of dominant males sire most of the offspring. Understanding how and why parents might adjust the sex of their offspring can provide insights into evolutionary strategies that maximize reproductive success.\nThe Trivers-Willard hypothesis suggests that parents in good condition or with high reproductive success may favor producing sons, as males have the potential for greater reproductive success in polygynous systems. On the other hand, parents with lower success might benefit from producing daughters, who have a more consistent chance of reproducing. My research tested this hypothesis in a colony of southern elephant seals breeding on the Kerguelen Archipelago."

We identified and sampled 74 breeding males and sexed and sampled 951 weaned pups the following year. Genetic analyses were performed using microsatellite markers to assign paternity with high confidence.\nWe also measured the body length of males as a proxy for age and physical condition, as these factors are known to influence dominance and reproductive success. Statistical models were used to analyze the relationship between paternal reproductive success and the likelihood of siring sons, accounting for factors like male tenure at the breeding site."

    "text": "Key findings\n\n\n\nUsing genetic markers to assign paternity to 540 pups from 58 breeding males, we found that males with higher reproductive success were more likely to sire sons. Specifically, the probability of producing a son increased from 43% for males with low reproductive success to 54% for the most successful males. This supports the idea that offspring sex ratio adjustment is an adaptive strategy in this species.\nInterestingly, while the overall sex ratio of weaned pups in the colony was balanced (50:50), the variation in sex ratio at the individual level was linked to the father’s reproductive success. This finding highlights the complex interplay between parental traits and reproductive strategies in shaping population dynamics."

It also raises intriguing questions about the mechanisms behind this adjustment—whether it is driven by males, females, or both."

However, even the best-performing metrics showed limited predictive power.\nIndividual variability matters: The predictive capacity of movement metrics varied significantly among individual seals, suggesting that foraging tactics differ between individuals. This highlights the importance of considering individual differences in behavioral studies.\nTemporal scale influences predictions: Movement metrics were more effective at predicting feeding intensity when analyzed at the scale of days rather than individual dives. This suggests that seals adjust their foraging behavior over longer time periods.\nData resolution is critical: High-resolution dive data provided more accurate insights into feeding behavior compared to low-resolution data, emphasizing the importance of detailed data collection in ecological studies.\n\nThese findings challenge the assumption that simple movement metrics can reliably infer feeding activity in free-ranging marine predators and underscore the complexity of foraging behavior in dynamic ocean environments."

However, this area accounted for only 3% of total feeding events, suggesting that most seals fed elsewhere, such as near haul-out sites like Norris Rocks.\n\nIndividual specialization\n\nI identified four distinct foraging strategies among the seals. A small group (17.6%) specialized in feeding on coho smolts in the estuary, while others targeted different prey or foraged in deeper waters. Interestingly, seals showed little response to the release of smaller Chinook smolts, likely because of their smaller size and lower energy density compared to coho smolts.\n\nImplications for salmon conservation\n\nMy findings revealed that only a small number of seals were responsible for most of the predation on coho smolts. This suggests that targeted management strategies, such as deterring specific individuals, could be more effective than broad measures that impact the entire seal population."
